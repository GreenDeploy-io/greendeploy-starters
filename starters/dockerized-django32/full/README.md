# Dockerized Django Default Starter

All GreenDeploy Starters are basically Cookiecutter Templates.

This specific Starter is the full stack for dockerized-django.

It's a variant that extends the default starter for dockerized-django

It makes the following decisions:

- tailwind + htmx + function based views instead of DRF
- Lifecycle hooks instead of signals
